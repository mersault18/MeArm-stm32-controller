# MeArm STM32 Controller for Tic-Tac-Toe

This project provides a driver and control firmware for the MeArm robotic arm, developed on an STM32 microcontroller. The robotic arm is equipped with an electromagnet at the end-effector, allowing it to pick and place magnetic game pieces in a physical tic-tac-toe game. The program handles servo control, positioning logic, and electromagnet activation to enable autonomous move execution.
